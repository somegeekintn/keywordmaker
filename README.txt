This represents the bare minimum of what I needed an app to do to parse CSV files from Google Analytics and use them to evaluate keywords to be used on ITC. Okay slightly mor than bare minimum since it's not a CLA. It may eventually serve as a jumping off point for something more.

It expects a CSV from one of the following on Google Analytics:
- Advertising -> AdWords -> Matched Search Queries
- or - 
- Traffics Sources -> Search Engine Optimization -> Queries
